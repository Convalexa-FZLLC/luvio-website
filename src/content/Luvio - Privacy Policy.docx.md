### 5. **THIRD-PARTY SERVICES**

Luvio does not share personal data with third parties except as necessary to provide the Service to you.

In many cases, third parties may collect personal data about your online activities over time and across different websites and services. The Services may contain links to websites, mobile applications and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not endorsement of, or representation that Luvio is affiliated with, any third party.  Third party privacy practices may be broader than what is set forth in this Privacy Policy and we strongly recommend that you read each third-party privacy policy carefully before using the Service. Please contact us directly using the information found below if you would like to learn more about third-party data practices.

### 6. **COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES** 

The Service uses tracking technologies, such as cookies (session based and support) and web beacons, to collect data about you, such as your IP address and device information. Based on this data, third parties may be able to resolve your identity across multiple devices. This data is collected, used and disclosed in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable third-party privacy policies. Certain Service features may rely on tracking technologies and by declining to accept cookies or by changing certain settings on your device, you may not have access to these features. 

### 7. **OBTAINING, RECTIFYING AND CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA**

Except as otherwise provided, this Privacy Policy applies to the data subjects of jurisdictions where there are privacy laws applicable to us and that grant their data subjects certain right with respect to the handling of their personal data. You may contact Luvio to obtain a copy of any personal data we collect about you, the production of which may be subject to a fee as permitted by applicable law. You may also contact Luvio to correct inaccurate personal data or to complete incomplete personal data. 

You may be able to opt-out of some or all of the ways in which your personal data is processed, or request the deletion of certain personal data, except where the personal data is necessary or vital for:

* the performance of our contractual obligations, such as the Terms or certain legal obligations agreed to between you and Luvio;

* protecting your interests or those of another person; and

* our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third-party,

and may do so by requesting deletion by contacting us using the contact information found below. 

### 8. **Data Storage and Retention**

While Luvio is a Canadian company, the data you provide through the Service may be stored and processed by third parties in countries around the world and by continuing to use the Service you hereby authorize Luvio and third parties acting on our behalf to process your data in any country of their choosing, which may cause your data, including personal data, to be subject to privacy protections and laws applicable in other jurisdictions. Luvio has taken steps to ensure its third-party data processors and storage providers comply with applicable laws and have implemented systems to secure your data. 

You may change certain information in your Account or terminate your account with Luvio at any time by logging into your Account settings and updating your account. Upon your request to terminate your Account, we will deactivate or delete your Account and information from our databases. However, we may retain some information for applicable periods in order to restore your Account, prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements. 

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal data and/or your relationship with Luvio comes to an end, we will promptly delete or anonymize any personal data Luvio has on file, in line with our legal obligations. Where deleting or anonymizing your personal data is not possible, Luvio will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. Any personal data that has been requested to be deleted or anonymized and is stored on a data backup will be held only temporarily and automatically purged after set expiration periods.

Luvio will only keep your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. In most instances, your personal data is retained until the earliest of: (a) when you request its deletion; (b) up to 90 days after Luvio no longer requires such data for the purpose for which it was collected; or (c) until required to be deleted by laws applicable in your jurisdiction. Please email us at support@luvio.ca to request the deletion of any personal data of yours that we hold. 

### 9. **Children**

The Service is not directed nor intended to be used by children under the age of majority and we do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of majority. If we learn that we inadvertently collected personal data from a child under the age of majority, in a jurisdiction where consent of a parent or guardian is required to be collected prior to the collection of such personal data, without first obtaining such appropriate parental consent, we will delete that data as quickly as possible. If you are a parent or guardian of a child under the age of majority, who you believe provided Luvio with personal data without your consent, please contact us at support@luvio.ca.

### 10. **DO NOT TRACK DISCLOSURE**

Do Not Track (“**DNT**”) is a web or device setting that allows users to request that receivers of personal data stop their tracking activities. When you choose to turn on the DNT setting in your browser or device or use alternative consumer choice mechanisms, your browser or device sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, advertising networks, plug in providers and other web services you encounter to stop tracking your activity.  Currently, there are no DNT technology standards and it is possible that there may never be any DNT technology standards.  As a result, we do not respond to DNT requests. 

### 11. **Change of Ownership or Business Transition**

In the event of, or in preparation for, a change of ownership or control of Luvio or a business transition such as the sale of some or all Luvio’s assets, we may disclose and/or transfer your personal data to third parties who will have the right to continue to collect and use such data in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy. Luvio will only disclose such personal data where the disclosure is subject to adequate privacy and confidentiality protections to ensure the security of your personal data in any proposed change of ownership or business transition.

### 12. **Security**

We are committed to ensuring that your data is secure. To prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or breach, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic, and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure the data we collect and process, including appropriate protections for any sensitive personal data we collect. These safeguards include regular security audits, encryption of data in transit and at rest, encryption of stored data, secure authentication and role-based access controls. Despite our safeguards and security, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be fully secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal or modify your information. Transmission of personal data to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

### 13. **Contact Preferences**

We will communicate with you primarily through your email address or other digital methods in order to conduct the Service and to respond to support requests or comments. If you have provided us with your email address and would like to change the email preferences we associate with you (for example, unsubscribing from receiving certain types of email) you may do so by clicking a link within certain types of emails that we send to you or, if no link is available, by replying with “unsubscribe” in the email title or body. On rare occasions, some types of email are necessary for the Service and cannot be unsubscribed from if you continue to use the Service.

### 14. **Updates**

Luvio reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy at any time (each an “**Update**”) and shall make each Update available on the Website and/or App (as applicable). You are deemed to accept an Update by continuing to use the Service. In the event an Update contains material changes to the way Luvio collects, processes, discloses or otherwise uses your personal data, we may provide you with additional notice through email or other contact methods you have provided to us. 

Unless Luvio states otherwise, an Update is automatically effective 30 days after posting on the Website and/or App, except in such case where an Update is immaterial to any of your legal rights or legal obligations of Luvio and such Update is made only to correct a typographical, formatting or grammar inaccuracy, and in such case, an Update is effective immediately after posting on the Website and/or App.
