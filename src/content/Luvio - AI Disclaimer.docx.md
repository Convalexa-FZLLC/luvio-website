Luvio Inc. (“**Luvio**,” “**we**,” “**our**,” or “**us**”) uses large language models and artificial intelligence (“**AI**”) technologies within the Luvio App and Service to enhance the user experience. This AI Disclosure (“**Disclosure**”) provides a summary of how Luvio uses AI, what it does, what it does not do, and how your information interacts with these systems. Your use of the AI features provided by Luvio is at your own discretion and governed by our Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Code of Conduct and any other agreement or policy Luvio requires you to agree to before using the Service. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have those meanings ascribed to them under the Luvio Terms & Conditions.

**BY EXECUTING AN AGREEMENT THAT REFERENCES THIS DISCLOSURE, BY CLICKING** “**I AGREE” OR SIMILAR CONFIRMATION, OR BY USING THE SERVICE YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THIS DISCLOSURE.** 

### 1. **HOW LUVIO USES AI**  
   
Luvio uses AI to provide optional experience-enhancement features on the Service. We have partnered with trusted third-party AI service providers in order to provide our users with additional compatibility and matching features. Examples of the AI systems used by Luvio and the information they process may include the following: 

AI Wing (our AI Conversation Assistant):

* Generates conversational questions to help users express themselves during onboarding.  
* Responds in a natural tone to maintain fluid conversation while users complete compatibility prompts.  
* May reference elements of a user’s recent answers solely to maintain conversational flow.  
* Luvio may implement additional features to the AI Wing after onboarding, including but not limited to use of the AI wing in a general conversational mode. These post-onboarding conversations are for optional engagement only and do not influence compatibility scoring, match suggestions, or any other personalized recommendations.  
* Does not make psychological diagnoses, classifications, or authoritative recommendations.  
* The AI Wing is not a substitute for professional advice and does not provide relationship counselling, psychological guidance or personalized behavioral analysis.  
* AI may produce variations of onboarding questions to improve personalization.  
* All AI-generated prompts and interactions are guided by  predefined conversational themes created by Luvio (e.g., lifestyle, values, preferences).  
* AI may assist in transforming user answers into compatibility data points.

Luvio Spark (QR Connection Feature):

* When two users scan one another’s Luvio Spark QR code, AI may compare their compatibility inputs and generate a compatibility score.  
* The Spark QR code does not share or display sensitive data — it only facilitates matching between app profiles.   
* Compatibility percentages are non-scientific, informational only, and not a guarantee of relationship success or outcomes.

### 2. **INFORMATION USED BY LUVIO AI**

Our AI features may use the following information to generate compatibility questions, conversational flow, and compatibility insights through the following processes:

* Your voluntary answers to onboarding and compatibility questions. (This may range from 1 to 20+ responses depending on the flow).  
* Your recent inputs during the AI conversation are used only to maintain a natural dialogue. (The AI may reference your recent answers solely to keep the conversation flowing).  
* Your basic profile attributes, some of which you may choose to opt-out of (e.g., age range preference, gender preference, sexual orientation, desired connection type, etc.).  
* Any other information you willing choose to provide to us directly or indirectly through the Service, including through your use of the AI features. 

How the AI Uses Your Information:

* The first set of onboarding/compatibility responses are used to generate a compatibility profile and potential match scores.  
* After compatibility assessments are completed, users may continue chatting with the AI in “conversation mode,” but these additional messages do NOT affect compatibility scores or matching.

Data Collection and Retention:

Luvio only uses the minimum required information necessary to provide the Service and its features (e.g., final compatibility scores or profile data). We do not store raw AI logs (inputs and outputs) beyond what is necessary for functionality, safety, or Service improvement. For more information on our data collection practices please refer to our Privacy Policy. All AI data is stored on secure servers and we do not sell personal data, compatibility data, or AI-generated insights to third-parties.

### 3. **WHAT LUVIO AI DOES NOT DO**

Luvio understands that AI is a new and continuously evolving technology, as such, we have taken commercially reasonable steps that attempt to restrict and limit the capabilities of our AI technologies. Your decision to use AI technologies is at your own discretion and must comply with our Terms and AI Acceptable Use Policy. 

For clarity, our AI features: (a) are not intended to make any legal, medical, financial, psychological or other professional decisions; (b) do not moderate our safety incidents, issue bans, or make binding safety or enforcement decisions;  (c) do not access your device outside the Service; (d) do not access private conversations between you and other users; (e) do not engage in contact or data scraping, background monitoring, or have microphone or camera access, unless you provide us with your express permission; (f) do not use AI-generated images; and (g) do not attempt to identify any sensitive information or protected characteristics, including but not limited to biometric information, information regarding your race, ethnicity, religion, disability, political preferences, or similar/related traits. 

Luvio maintains human oversight over the AI features and all enforcement and moderation actions (blocking, reports, bans, warnings, content removal, etc…) are manually reviewed and approved by human members of the Luvio staff. We strive to continually review all AI tools and features for fairness, accuracy, safety and instances of misuse. The AI features are provided on an “AS IS” and “WHEN AVAILABLE” basis and Luvio reserves the right to temporarily disable AI features in its sole and absolute discretion, including during reported instances of AI malfunctions. 

You retain discretion over your use of the AI features and may decline to answer AI-generated questions, skip and/or exit the AI-assisted onboarding, and otherwise refuse to provide personal data the AI features may process. Use of the AI features does not guarantee or determine the success of any relationship outcomes and Luvio expressly disclaims any and all representations, warranties and covenants regarding the accuracy of AI outputs and associated outcomes. 

### 4. **UPDATES TO THIS DISCLOSURE**

Luvio reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Disclosure at any time (each, an “**Update**”) and shall make each Update available through the Website, the App or App Store and/or through email notification. You are deemed to accept an Update by continuing to use the Service. Unless Luvio states otherwise, an Update is automatically effective 30 days after posting, except in such case where an Update is immaterial to any of your legal rights or legal obligations of Luvio and such Update is made only to correct a typographical, formatting or grammar inaccuracy, and in such case, an Update is effective immediately after posting.
